## Autopsy Cluster

**Coming soon**  

The project is a modification of [Autopsy](http://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy) and [Sleuthkit](http://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit) so that it can perform the image acquisition and ingest steps in parallel.  An overview of this project was presented at the [Open Source Digital Forensics Conference (OSDFCon)](http://www.osdfcon.org/) in October 2016.

AutopsyCluster source code will be available here in the near future. 

For more information or to become a beta tester, please contact us at [AutopsyCluster@rand.org](mailto://autopsycluster@rand.org).
